# Tuner
tuner in python with FFT, to be updated

the tuner.py file is the main file and basically creates the window and the components, all the data also passes to be displayed on the components into this file

the audiothread.py file is mainly for the thread created to record the input from the microphone and analyze it with FFT, then passing the detected frequency back to the tuner.py file component 

constants.py just stores some commonly used constants for convience

this is something that is still undergoing development, so expect more updates in the future!
